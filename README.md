&nbsp;

## What's the idea behind this project?
**Do more, install less.** This project gives you the strict minimum that you need to quickly start using the 1588 icons of Font Awesome 5.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Why is there only .woff font files?
Woff font format is supported by every modern browser: https://caniuse.com/#search=woff, and Font Awesome works fine with only these files.

## How to install & use this local repository in your project?

1) Copy the entire 'fa' folder into your project directory 


2) Link it inside your ```<head>``` by adding this: ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="fa/all.min.css">```
  

3) And voil√†! You are ready to go!

Exemple: ```<span class="fas fa-search">Search</span>```

## Font Awesome 5 notes
The 'fa' prefix has been deprecated in version 5. The new default is the 'fas' (solid) style and the 'fab' style for brands.
