# FontAwesome5
A solution to include a local version of Font Awesome 5, to increase loading speed, give you more control over FA, and allow you to work localy without Internet connection



# How to install & use this local repository in your project?
-----------------------------------------

1) Copy the entire 'fa' folder into your project directory

2) Link your web files to the 'fa' folder using the link rel tag in your <header>: <link rel="stylesheet" href="fa/all.min.css">

3) Finally, include the Font Awesome 5 icons as you want! Ex: <span class="fas fa-search">Search</span>



# Font Awesome 5 important note
-----------------------------------------
The 'fa' prefix has been deprecated in version 5. The new default is the 'fas' (solid) style and the 'fab' style for brands.
